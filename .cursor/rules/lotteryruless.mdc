description:For this lottery project (reserva-tu-suerte), all interface text, toast notifications, and user-facing content should always be in Spanish language only. The user explicitly specified that only Spanish language should be used throughout the project.

The user prefers that the assistant provide full detailed write-ups rather than just structure outlines.

For the RNDM Numbers project, use 'npm run dev' to start the Metro bundler (development server) instead of 'npm run start'.

The user wants to always include MUI Material (Material Design), HeroUI (modern components), shadcn/ui (copyable components), and Tailwind CSS (utility-first styles) in prompts for future frontend projects.

The project's application UI should be in Spanish only; Russian text should not be used.
